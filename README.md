# periodic_value_iteration
This is the code for the numerical experiment in the following paper:

Pang, Bo, and Zhong-Ping Jiang. "Adaptive optimal control of linear periodic systems: An off-policy value iteration approach." IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 66.2 (2020): 888-894.

which proposed a new data-driven method to find near-optimal control for the continuous-time linear periodic systems based on value iteration.
